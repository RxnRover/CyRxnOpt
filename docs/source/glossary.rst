   budget
      A user-provided number of :term:`optimization steps <optimization step>`
      to be attempted before abandoning the :term:`optimization cycle`.

   CyRxnOpt ID
       The *exact* identifier of an optimizer to use when an optimizer name is required when calling a CyRxnOpt function.

   experiment
       In the context of reaction optimization, we consider an experiment to be
       one :term:`optimization cycle`.

   experiment directory
      Directory containing all files generated for a specific
      :term:`experiment`.

   objective function
      The function you wish to minize or maximize in your optimization problem.
      In reaction optimization, this is typically your reaction, where reaction
      parameters are function input and reaction analysis is the function output
      (yield, conversion %, or more complex results).

   optimization cycle
      When optimizing a reaction or function, an optimization cycle is
      considered to be all:term:`optimization steps <optimization step>` from
      the start of the optimization until either an optimum satisfying the
      algorithm's stop conditions is found or the :term:`budget` is reached.

   optimization iteration
      See :term:`optimization step`.

   optimization step
      Optimization algorithms work by suggesting a set of parameter values that
      are evaluated on an :term:`objective function`. The result is provided
      back to the optimizer and the algorithm determines the next set of
      paramter values to provide.
