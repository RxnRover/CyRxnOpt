Introduction
============

Optimization algorithms experience widespread application in economics,
molecular modeling, and industrial processes. In chemistry, optimization of
reactions for objectives like desired product yield, selectivity, cost
efficiency, and conversion is a necessity as well. This is typically performed
using a chemist's intuition combined with one variable at a time (OVAT) or
Design of Experiments (DoE) techniques. Mathematical optimization
algorithms designed in other fields have found success when applied to chemical
reaction optimization, but the various interfaces, programming skills, and
technical debugging, and installation methods required to use an optimization
algorithm is usually not considered worth the effort by most chemists. When
targeting reaction optimization, the algorithms are expected to be used in the
laboratory, likely by someone without much programming experience.
Compounded on these issues, there is no one-size-fits-all algorithm so
chemists need to switch algorithms based on which will perform the best on
their reaction of interest, with each new algorithm bringing its unique twist
on the challenges enumerated above. With these challenges in mind, aside from
a few exemplary laboratories, reaction optimization algorithms have still not
achieved widespread use in the field of basic chemistry.

To lower the barrier of entry between chemists and reaction optimization
algorithms, user-friendly interfaces need to be designed between the chemist
and the algorithm on multiple levels. EDBO+ provides a great example of this
by providing a web interface as well as a relatively straightforward API.
Our team has also designed Rxn Rover, a reaction automation platform that
strives to create a user-friendly program to allow chemists to connect
optimization algorithms directly to their reactors in a flexible way.

However, both approaches currently have issues. The EDBO+ web interface only
works for the EDBO+ algorithm, which may not be the best choice for all
reactions. Rxn Rover provides plugins for different optimization algorithms
that are easily loaded in the program, but each of these plugins is difficult
and time consuming to produce. On a level between these user interfaces and
the optimization algorithms, there is a need for an abstracted interface that
allows access to multiple optimization algorithms through common commands and
formatting. It must also be relatively straightforward to add new optimization
algorithm support to this interface.

Due to the myriad possible applications, implementations, and programming
languages, it is likely impossible to define one abstract interface that will
unilaterraly apply to all optimization algorithms in all fields. However,
narrowing the scope to chemical reaction optimization, algorithms are commonly
implemented in Python with one application in mind, optimize a reaction for
*x*, *y*, *z* results. This significantly reduces the number of challenges
in creating an abstract optimization algorithm interface.

CyRxnOpt aims to provide a single software interface that can provide access
to many different optimization algorithms, mainly designed for use in chemical
reaction optimization. It breaks chemical reaction optimization in to four
main steps: Installation, Configuration, Training, Prediction.
This allows users to program to a single software interface, simplifying the
development of user-friendly tools and interfaces to lower the barrier of
entry into reaction optimization.
